                    <p>
                        My applied CS degree gave me the unique perspective of software development from a cybersecurity view. 
                        My courses included programming in languages such as Python, C++, C, as well as bash and Linux command line experience.
                        I also took courses on web development using NodeJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django, as well as database setup and
                        management with SQL and PostgreSQL. My cybersecurity courses taught me computer networking protocols and security,
                        as well as threat detection / response.
