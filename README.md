### Hello, my name is Martin Barker and I'm a Seattle software developer who loves music.
This repo is for my personal website www.martinbarker.me


## How to develop for this Website:
- Fork and clone the Repo.
- Install the packages/dependecies for this website by running the command `npm i`.
- Make changes, push them to your forked branch, and make a pull request. If It looks good I'll merge it in!

## How colors work for this website:
- Every time you load a page on this website, a random image is chosen from the folder `\static\assets\aesthetic-images`
- Color Data is generated for this image, including the 6 most prominent colors: Vibrant, Light Vibrant, Dark Vibrant, Muted, Light Muted, and Dark Muted.
- These colors are sent to the page's CSS content to color different parts of the page.
- For each area where color is applied, the text color is also calculated as to weather it is better to color the text black or white.
